                        <p>In a bid to cut down on the number of child sexual abuse in the world, parents/ guardians are
                            adviced to teach their kids body part at a young age.
                            Mention body parts and talk about them very often. Use right names for body parts, when you
                            are comfortably using these words and telling them what they mean, this can help a child
                            speak out if something wrong has happened. You can teach your kids body part in the
                            following manner;
                        </p>

                        <div class="support-list">
                            <ul>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Teach them that their Body Parts are Private
                                </li>
                                <p>Teach your children that their private parts are called private because they are not
                                    meant for everyone to see. Tell them people cannot see them naked.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Teach your Child Body Boundaries
                                </li>
                                <p>Tell your child that no one should touch their private parts and that no one should
                                    ask them to touch somebody else’s private parts. Parents often leave out the second
                                    part of this sentence. Sexual abuse usually begins with the abuser asking the child
                                    to touch them or someone else.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Tell your Child that Body Secrets are not okay</li>
                                <p>Some abusers will tell the child to keep the abuse a secret. This can be done in a
                                    friendly way, such as, “I love playing with you, but if you tell anyone else what we
                                    played they won’t let me come over again.” Or it can be a threat: “This is our
                                    secret, if you tell anyone I will kill you.” Educate your kids that no matter what
                                    anybody tells them, body secrets are not good and they should make sure they tell
                                    you if somebody tries to force them keep body secret.
                                </p>

                                <p>This one is mostly left out by parents. This world is filled with pedophiles that
                                    take and sell pictures of naked children online and it puts your child at risk. Tell
                                    your kids that no one is permitted to take pictures of their private parts.

                                <p>Some children are afraid telling people “NO”, especially older adults. Teach them
                                    that it’s okay to tell an adult “NO” and that they have to leave, if he/she is
                                    asking them to do something against what Mummy/Daddy has taught them. Also, help
                                    give them words to get out of uncomfortable situations.

                                <p>As children get older, you can give them a code word that they can use when they are
                                    in danger.

                                <p>Children always tell their abusers that they didn’t say anything because they feel
                                    they will get into trouble. This fear is always used by the abuser. Teach your child
                                    that you’re their safe heaven and no harm can come to them for telling you a body
                                    secret.

                                <p>Many parents and books talk about “Good touch and Bad Touch,” but this can be
                                    confusing because often these touches do not hurt or feel bad. I prefer the term
                                    “Secret Touch,” as it is a better deception of what may happen. Make your kids
                                    understand that some touch may feel good, but they’re bad touch.
