                                </li>
                                <p>Trafficked children are sexually exploited by child pornography. The United States
                                    defines child pornography as any visual activities depiction of sexually conduct
                                    involving a minor. Federal law prohibits any production, distribution, importation,
                                    reception, or possession of any image, video, or depiction of child pornography.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Child Sex Trafficking</li>
                                <p>Child sex trafficking refers to all activities including the recruitment, harboring,
                                    transporting, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or solicitation of minor for a
                                    commercial sex act. Criminals such as pimps and traffickers mainly target children
                                    who are vulnerable due to impoverished conditions. These offenders deceived parents
                                    and children with offers of love, friendship, housing, food, clothing, attention, or
                                    everything that will make their life beautiful.
                                    Once a trafficker has earned the trust of victims they will engage the child into
                                    acts of prostitution using psychological, emotional, and physical abuse. These acts
                                    are aimed to trap children and people in lives of prostitution.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Child Hard Labor</li>
                                <p>Many times child trafficking end kids in harmful or physically hard labor. The global
                                    estimates for children in hazardous labor exceed 73 million. These children are
                                    forced to carry heavy loads, scavenge garbage dumps, using dangerous agricultural
                                    equipment, forced to be child soldiers, and even end up begging.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Child Drug Smugglers
                                </li>
                                <p>Children are always trafficked for the function of drug smuggling. They are used for
                                    transportation and also as dealers of drugs on the streets. Many times they are
                                    given drugs for their work which further enslaves them through addiction. Worse
                                    children who are used for this type of child trafficking are treated as nothing more
                                    than criminals. That means they are victimized twice, once by traffickers and again
                                    by the legal system.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Child Domestic Slavery</li>
                                <p>Some children end up doing domestic work like slaves did in our world’s history. They
                                    are forced to clean, cook, and pick up after people. Being kidnapped or having
                                    parents accepting into allowing this to happen leaves kids suffering. They are
                                    objects, possessions to be bought, sold.
                                </p>
                                <p>Common examples of child domestic slavery are working in restaurants, homes, hotels,
                                    or other areas where morally corrupt business owners are looking for cheap labor.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Children Trafficked For Adoption</li>
                                <p>Currently a reality of our world is children are taken and used to fill adoption
                                    biddings. International adoption is the most common type of child trafficking for
                                    the purpose of adoption. Children are taken from homes, orphanages, schools, parks.
                                    Most people think uncontrollable children as the only vulnerable category, it isn’t
                                    true. Many parents are tricked, or threatened into giving up their children.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Causes of Child Trafficking</h4>
                                <p>There are so many causes of child trafficking, but we would just focus on the 3 main
                                    causes of child trafficking.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Poverty</li>
                                <p>Poverty is the common cause of child trafficking. Poor families in many cases have no
                                    choice but to abandon their children. This makes them orphaned and easy targets for
                                    child trafficking. Poverty is the primary cause for a lot of children left on the
                                    streets. These children are easily lured in by promises of a better life from
                                    traffickers posing as humanitarians.
                                    Even in cases where children are still living with parents in poor homes, they are
                                    vulnerable. Some parents are deceived into stories from traffickers about how they
                                    can help their children find education and employment.
                                </p>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Lack of Education</li>
                                <p>When children don’t have the basic skills to support themselves they are more
                                    vulnerable. Illiteracy is one of the common issues that lead children to being
                                    trafficked. They can’t read anything around them and have no idea where they are or
                                    who their captors are.

                                </p>

                                <p>During crisis where children are lost or orphaned, trafficking is mostly common. Be
                                    it an earthquake, pandemic, or other disruption child trafficking increases in these
                                    times and locations. While it is more common in countries where human rights are
                                    already being violated child traffickers take any opportunity to find, transport,
                                    and sell children.
